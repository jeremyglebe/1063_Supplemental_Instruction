# 1063_Supplemental_Instruction
Code and misc files from my supplemental instruction sessions and tutoring at
Midwestern State University. Most of the files come from the Data Structures &
ADT class.

## Who am I?
My name is Jeremy Glebe. I am a software developer, a computer science student
at Midwestern State University, and a supplemental instructor for Data
Structures & ADT (also at MSU). I upload everything I work on with students
here so they can access it and look back over it at a later time. Some code is
thoroughly commented and some isn't. Students who attended the session/tutoring
should have notes to look back over.
